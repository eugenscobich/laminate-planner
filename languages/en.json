  "helpText": "Welcome to the Laminate Floor Planner!<br><br>This application lets you visualize, plan, and arrange laminate boards on your chosen floor layout. Use the guide below to get started and make the most of all available features.<br><br><b>1. Loading a Floor Plan</b><br>Open a DXF file:<br>Click the \"Choose file\" button and choose a valid .dxf file containing your floor outline.<br>You can rotate the plan, add a line or rectangle.<br>View & Zoom:<br>Once loaded, you’ll see your floor plan lines on the main canvas.<br>Use your mouse scroll wheel or trackpad to zoom in/out.<br>Click & drag to pan around the canvas.<br><br><b>2. Setting Board Parameters</b><br>Board Dimensions:<br>In the left controls, enter your board Length and Width in millimeters (or your chosen units).<br>Offset & Initial Cut:<br>Board Offset lets you offset successive rows by a chosen amount (e.g., half the board width).<br>Board Initial Cut helps simulate cutting the first board in the first row by a specified amount.<br>Minimal Board Remainings & Other Options:<br>Enable \"Do not use small remainings\" if you want to discard leftover pieces below a minimum length.<br>Optimize Start the Row tries to cleverly position the first board of each row.<br><br><b>3. Adding Rows & Boards</b><br>Add a Row or a Board:<br>Use the \"Add Row\" button to insert a new row of boards.<br>Use the \"Add Board\" button to place the next board in the current row segment.<br>Full Complete:<br>The \"Full Complete\" button attempts to fill the entire floor area with boards based on your current parameters, creating as many rows and boards as needed.<br><br><b>4. Editing & Arranging</b><br>Zoom & Pan:<br>Zoom with your mouse wheel; hold left-click and move to pan around.<br><br><b>5. Viewing Statistics</b><br>Statistics Section:<br>The “Statistics” area on the left panel shows:<br>Total number of boards used.<br>Total square of boards.<br>Floor area covered.<br>Remaining square from leftover pieces.<br>Estimated Cost based on the cost per m² you entered.<br>Cost Calculation:<br>Enter your Cost per square meter in the “Cost” field.<br>The application multiplies the total used board area by this cost to estimate your total spending.<br><br><b>6. Exporting Your Plan</b><br>Export as PDF:<br>Click Export button to obtain a pdf file with the plan inside<br><br><b>7. Tips & Troubleshooting</b><br>Ensure Valid Inputs: Double-check board height, width, offset, and initial cut values are numeric and make sense for your layout.<br>Small Boards or Gaps: If boards don’t fill the area exactly, consider adjusting the minimal remainings or initial cut.<br>Performance: Extremely large DXF files may slow down rendering. Consider simplifying your floor plan beforehand.<br><br><b>8. Additional Help</b><br>Bug Reporting:<br>If you encounter issues or unexpected behavior, let us know by creating an issue on our GitHub repository or contacting support.<br><br>We hope you find the Laminate Floor Planner helpful! If you have more questions, check the official documentation or open a GitHub issue for assistance. <br>eugen.scobich@gmail.com<br>@eugenscobich",
